# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my DSA Repository! 🚀 This repository contains concepts, problems, and solutions categorized by different DSA topics. It's intended as a learning and reference collection of implementations, mostly in C++ (with a few Python examples).

> Note — In each file, the comments explaining the concepts, the question/solution are written by me. Comments on the code are written using the help of GPT.

## What you'll find here

- Organized folders for common DSA topics: Arrays, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, and more.
- Example problems and solutions (mostly C++). Many files include short explanations as comments at the top of the file.
- Small utility programs and learning snippets.

## Repository structure (top-level folders)

- `Algorithms/` — Algorithm-specific examples
- `Arrays/` — Array problems and techniques
- `BackTracking/` — Backtracking examples
- `Binary Search/` — Binary search problems and partitions
- `Graphs/` — Graph algorithms and traversals
- `Linked List/` — Singly, doubly and circular linked list examples
- `Greedy Algo/` — Greedy approach problems
- `Dynamic Programming/` — DP problems and solutions
- `Sorting/` — Sorting algorithms (e.g., selection, quicksort)
- `Strings C++/` — String manipulations in C++
- ...and many more topic folders. Browse the folders to find specific implementations.

*(The full folder listing is available in the repository root — this README highlights the common folders.)*

## How to compile and run (C++ examples)

Most code files are single-file C++ programs. To compile and run a file using g++ (MinGW or WSL), use:

```powershell
# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall "path\to\file.cpp" -o "path\to\output.exe"

# Run
"path\to\output.exe"
```

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the C/C++ extension or configure a tasks.json to build and run files easily. Some example files include their own comments about input format.

## How to use (quick)

1. Pick a folder/topic (e.g., `Sorting/`).
2. Open a file (e.g., `SelectionSorting.cpp`).
3. Read the comments at the top for the problem description and approach.
4. Compile and run with sample input (if any).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a problem or improve an explanation:

- Open an issue describing the change.
- Send a PR with a clear commit message and code comments.
- Keep code style consistent with existing files.

## Notes about authorship and comments

- Problem statements and conceptual explanations in files are written by the repository owner.
- Inline code comments were assisted/expanded using GPT to improve clarity.

## License

You can add a license file if you wish (e.g., MIT). For now, treat this repository as personal learning material; check with the owner before reusing large parts.

Happy learning! If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `LICENSE`.
- Generate a small script to compile-and-run examples quickly.
- Create a table of contents listing all files and short descriptions.

If you'd like any of those, tell me which and I'll add them.
