# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my DSA Repository! 🚀 This repository contains concepts, problems, and solutions categorized by different DSA topics. It's intended as a learning and reference collection of implementations, mostly in C++ (with a few Python examples).

> Note — In each file, the comments explaining the concepts.Comments on the code are written using the help of GPT.

## What you'll find here

- Organized folders for common DSA topics: Arrays, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, and more.
- Example problems and solutions (mostly C++). Many files include short explanations as comments at the top of the file.
- Small utility programs and learning snippets.
