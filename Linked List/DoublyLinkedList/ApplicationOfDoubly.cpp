//  Application of Doubly Linked List

// Doubly linked list can be used in various applications. Some of them are:

// 1. Undo Operation: Doubly linked list can be used to implement undo operations. In this case, the current state of the application is stored in a doubly linked list. When the user performs an operation, the current state is saved in a node and added to the list. If the user wants to undo the operation, the list is traversed in reverse order to restore the previous state.

// 2. Browser History: Doubly linked list can be used to implement browser history. In this case, the URLs visited by the user are stored in a doubly linked list. When the user navigates to a new page, the URL is added to the list. The user can then navigate back and forth through the history by traversing the list.


// 3. Music Player: Doubly linked list can be used to implement a music player. In this case, the songs in a playlist are stored in a doubly linked list. The user can play the songs in order or shuffle the playlist. The user can also skip to the next or previous song by traversing the list.

// 4. Text Editor: Doubly linked list can be used to implement a text editor. In this case, the text is stored in a doubly linked list. The user can insert, delete, or modify text by traversing the list. The user can also undo or redo operations by traversing the list in reverse order.
